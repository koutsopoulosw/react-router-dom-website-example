# React Vite Project Example with React Router Dom

This is an example project I made to practice React, React Router dom, and CSS. Started with Vite, as create-react-app seems to be not so good anymore.

# Run
After installing dependencies with

```
npm install
```

Start project with

```
npm run dev
```

# Testing

# Other

git remote set-url origin https://koutsopoulosw@github.com/koutsopoulosw/react-router-dom-website-example.git
```
